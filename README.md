# finalexam
The final exam for my Version 1 course.

Just starting out trying to expand my job skills to work in a new environment.  New at development processes, the software is all new to me and most of my computing science knowledge is 15 years old at this point.  I spectacularly bombed week 4 quiz for this class so I hope I make up for it here.
